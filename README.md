I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer
Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu) at the [University of
Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). I am member of
[MadS&P](https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu) and advised by [Prof. Patrick
McDaniel](http://patrickmcdaniel.org). Previously, I earned my M.S. and B.S. in
computer science and engineering from the [Pennsylvania State
University](https://www.psu.edu).

My research is at the intersection of computer security and machine learning. I
investigate [the risks of deploying machine learning systems in
security-centric domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08619), [how their
robustness can be measured at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04521), [and their applications towards novel security
problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10387). I also apply computer security
principles to [radiation
detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168900222003643),
[Internet measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05122), and [Internet of
Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09338).
