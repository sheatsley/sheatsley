I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at
the [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.eecs.psu.edu). I am lead
graduate student of the [Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security
Laboratory](https://cybersecurity.psu.edu) and advised by [Prof. Patrick
McDaniel](http://patrickmcdaniel.org).

My research focuses on the security of machine learning systems and their
applications towards novel security problems. I am investigating how machine
learning systems can be securely deployed in security-centric domains, such as
network intrusion detection. My research has also extended to radiation
detection, public cloud security, and privacy in Internet of Things.
