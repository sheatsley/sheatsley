I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer
Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu) at the [University of
Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). I am member of
[MadS&P](https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu) and advised by [Prof. Patrick
McDaniel](http://patrickmcdaniel.org). Previously, I earned my M.S. and B.S. in
computer science and engineering from the [Pennsylvania State
University](https://www.psu.edu).

My research is at the intersection of computer security and machine learning. I
investigate the risks of deploying machine learning systems in security-centric
domains, how their robustness can be measured at scale, and their applications
towards novel security problems. I also apply computer security principles to
radiation detection, Internet measurement, and Internet of Things.
